# gmod-puppet

This modifies the traditional player animation system in Garry's Mod to separate players into their own visual (puppet) and animation (puppeteer) models.

**WARNING**: This should only be used if you're 100% set on using it, since it will make permanent changes to the [Player](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player) meta table.
