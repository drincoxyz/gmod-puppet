# gmod-skelemation

This modifies the traditional player animation system in Garry's Mod to assign players their own visual (exoskeleton) and animation (endoskeleton) models.

**WARNING**: This should only be used if you're 100% set on using it, as it will make permanent changes to the [Player](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player) meta table.
